Then, run the following command to initialize Languine.

```

Follow the steps to set up your project.

## First Translation

Now you are ready to translate your code.

Start by adding a key to your source file, for example if you choose to use `en.json` as your source file, add a key to it.

```json
{
  "hello": "Hello"
}
```

Then run the following command to translate your code.

```bash
languine translate
```

We will then translate the key you added to your target languages.
